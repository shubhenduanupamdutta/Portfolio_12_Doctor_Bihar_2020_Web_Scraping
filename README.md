# Portfolio_12_Custom_Web_Scraper

## Twelfth (12) Portfolio Project - Custom Web Scraper

## I will use selenium to get to the bihar medical board registered doctor table and parse data using pandas
## Finally I should be able to get all 1461 doctors list.

## Notes:
 - I have used doctor list, because I am an Indian and wanted to something with doctors
 - I have used pandas and lxml to parse html because it is faster and uses less code.
 - I had problem selecting options, after browsing on web I get that I can execute a JS code to make visible and then scrape.
 - I have used selenium to execute JS code.
